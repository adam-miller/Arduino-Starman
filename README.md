# Arduino-Starman
Light-up Christmas Tree Topper

Found from https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/k0k0fa/our_first_3d_designed_printed_and_programmed/
A few changes from the original. Added a small raised border to the face cover to enlarge the black border via a filament change added to the slicer settings. Fixed the schematic for the tx/rx pins and hopefully made the button pins clearer. Mine was printed in yellow PLA instead of clear, with 3 top/bottom layers, 3 wall lines ad 20% lines infill.
